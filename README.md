# econ_metadata
Scrapes and analyzes metadata from EconLit for all papers published in the 2010s. 

# Overview

JEL codes are awesome. The goal here is to get the JEL codes for every paper published in the 2010s, along with authors, author affiliation, journal name, etc. Plenty of schools says "we're the best for IO or mechanism design or urban or whatever", with this data, we can actually see which departments publish the most in which fields!

So far, have only uploaded scraping code. This takes forever to run in PhantomJS on my personal machine, so I'm hoping to get time on a much faster machine (and better internet access) to download metadata for articles in the full period. 

Need to remember to add journal name to metadata next time I upload.
